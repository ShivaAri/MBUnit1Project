Kathakali Du Toribia is a delightful little trivia game that is based off of various types of media: including games and anime. 
The goal of this game is to acquire 8 correct answers before the timer runs completely out~!
When an answer is clicked, a sound effect plays, indicating that it is the correct or incorrect answer.
You will have unlimited tries for each question, but there is a time limit. 120 seconds is all you have to completely attain the 8 correct answers you need for victory.
